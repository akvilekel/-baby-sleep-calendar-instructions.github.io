    <h1>Baby Sleep Calendar & Log: Usage Instructions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Baby Sleep Calendar & Log</strong>, the intuitive app crafted for contemporary parents. This guide will help you navigate the app's features to track and optimize your child's sleep patterns effectively.</p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Upon opening the app, you will be greeted with a user-friendly interface that presents a monthly view of your baby’s sleep log. The app's main screen shows the current date highlighted and offers a quick overview of the sleep entries.</p>
    <h2>Logging Sleep Data</h2>
    <p>To input new sleep data:<br><br>
    Tap the '+' icon located at the bottom right corner, beneath the calendar view. A new log entry screen will appear for the selected date.</p>
    <h2>Detailed Log Entry Fields</h2>
    <p><strong>Quality of Sleep:</strong><br>
    Good Sleep: Indicates undisturbed, peaceful rest.<br>
    Fair Sleep: Reflects average quality sleep with some awakenings.<br>
    Poor Sleep: Denotes a restless night with frequent awakenings.<br><br>
    <strong>Night Awakenings:</strong> Record the number of times your baby woke up during the night.<br><br>
    <strong>Awake Time During the Night:</strong> Note the total duration your baby was awake during the night.<br><br>
    <strong>Woke Up:</strong> Enter the time your baby woke up in the morning.<br><br>
    <strong>Night Sleep Hours:</strong> This is automatically calculated based on the 'fell asleep' time entered; no manual entry is needed.<br><br>
    <strong>Number of Naps:</strong> Input the count of your baby’s naps throughout the day.<br><br>
    <strong>Day Sleep Hours:</strong> Log the cumulative amount of daytime sleep.<br><br>
    <strong>Fell Asleep:</strong> In the evening, record when your baby fell asleep to complete the daily sleep cycle tracking.<br><br>
    <strong>Notes Section:</strong> Add any pertinent notes that could affect sleep patterns, such as routine changes, vaccinations, and so on.</p>
    <h2>Editing Entries</h2>
    <p>All data entries are editable. You can revisit and modify any logged information as needed to ensure accuracy.</p>
    <h2>Monthly Calendar Overview</h2>
    <p>Once logged, entries will populate the monthly calendar view. Tap on a date to see detailed information about the sleep data recorded for that particular day.</p>
    <h2>Using the App to Understand Sleep Patterns</h2>
    <p><strong>Baby Sleep Calendar & Log</strong> is more than a data repository – it's a companion in your parenting journey. By consistently logging sleep information, you can track your child’s progress, identify patterns, and recognize potential issues to address them promptly.</p>
